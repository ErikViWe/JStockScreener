The JStockScreener is a stock screening tool providing a huge variety of indicators used in the technical analysis of stock markets. Using the "Yahoo! Finance API", this project has access to a massive collection of historical as well as current stock prices from more than 1000 stock market listed companies.

Important: Use of the JStockScreener on own responsibility. Due to possible incompleteness of some data sets as well as a different calculation of indicators, the result may vary of results from other stock screening tools.
